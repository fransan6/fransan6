## Hi, I'm Francesca 👋
I'm a recent full-stack development graduate and apparently am now obsessed with all things programming. I'm keen to solidify my newly-acquired skills but also learn more and keep on furthering my professional development. I bring both strong technical and soft skills and, when necessary, plenty of snacks.

### :fire: Projects
- [What Can I Eat?](http://www.whatcanieat.world/) Final Le Wagon group project. Rails web app to supply recipes based on a user's ingredients. Set up models, controllers, views and schema; built and aided with filtering, review and bookmark functionality; created friendships, where users could send invites, and accept or reject others' requests; implemented AJAX and an API. Also led and participated in frequent stand-ups, created and utilised Trello and worked both independently and in pair-programming. [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexagodzilla/what-can-i-eat).
- [Pay and Play](https://github.com/alexagodzilla/venues-pay-and-play) First Le Wagon group project, setting up amateur musicians with venues. Worked on set-up of MVC framework and schema, and helped integration of Mapbox and Google APIs. Conducted stand-ups and led the use of Trello.
