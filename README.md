### Hi, I'm Francesca 👋
I'm a recent graduate of Le Wagon's full-stack web development bootcamp and apparently am now obsessed with, and love, all things coding (handy, given the time and money invested). I'm keen to both solidify my newly-acquired skills, but also learn more and keep on furthering my professional development. I bring both technical and soft skills and, when necessary, plenty of snacks.

### :fire: Projects
- [What Can I Eat?](http://www.whatcanieat.world/) Final Le Wagon project. Rails web app to help users not waste food they already have and supply recipes based on their ingredients. In addition, you can make friends and chat to them, and store kitchen staples in an online pantry. Built models; controllers; views; SQL schema; friendship, reviews, bookmark  and filtering functionality; AJAX to improve a user's experience, to list a few. [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexagodzilla/what-can-i-eat).
- [Venues Pay and Play](https://github.com/alexagodzilla/venues-pay-and-play) First Le Wagon project. Rails web app to link up amateur musicians with venues that they can practice in. Took part in frequent stand-ups, utilised Trello and worked independently and in pair-programming.
