## Hi, I'm Francesca 👋
I'm a recent graduate of Le Wagon's full-stack web development bootcamp and apparently am now obsessed with, and love, all things coding (handy, given the time and money invested). I'm keen to both solidify my newly-acquired skills, but also learn more and keep on furthering my professional development. I bring both technical and soft skills and, when necessary, plenty of snacks.

### :fire: Projects
- [What Can I Eat?](http://www.whatcanieat.world/) Final Le Wagon project. Rails web app to help users not waste food they already have and supply recipes based on their ingredients. Built models; controllers; views; SQL schema; friendship, review, bookmark and filtering functionality; AJAX to improve a user's experience, to list a few. [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexagodzilla/what-can-i-eat).
- [Venues Pay and Play](https://github.com/alexagodzilla/venues-pay-and-play) First Le Wagon project. Rails web app to link up amateur musicians with venues that they can practice in. Took part in frequent stand-ups, utilised Trello and worked independently and in pair-programming.
